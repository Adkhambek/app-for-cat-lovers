# App for cat lovers

## Task:

Your neighbor likes cats very much, but she can't look for all her pets. You need to implement an application for her:

1. Every 5 second your app generates a new cat and adds it to first list. New cat has name (you can prepare list of names and take a random from there), color, age and (important!) if cat has collar or not with probability=50%.
2. If new cat doesn't have a collar, then it's homeless and your neighbor adopt it - so you need to add this cat to second list - list of your neighbor's cats.
3. Every cat becomes hungry every 30 seconds and button 'feed' appears in the row with hungry cat. If you will not feed it in 5 seconds, then this cat disappears from both lists.

**❗️ You need to use class components lifecycle methods**
